# Odoo App

## Purpose 
Odoo is the latest popular ERP system. It's considerably more efficient than the leading SAP, and surprisingly, much more affordable.
Odoo offers a range of apps to cater to most company requirements, but interestingly, there isn't one specifically for energy management.

Recent crises, like the war in Ukraine, have highlighted the importance of energy for every businesses and the significance of an efficient energy management is poised to grow even further in the coming years. 
This is especially true with the ongoing electrification of society and the escalating importance of renewable energy sources, which tend to be less consistent compared to fossil fuels.
Furthermore, renewables present opportunities for even small companies to generate their own energy and potentially even sell any excess back to the grid. 
This potential for self-sustained energy production can be a game-changer for businesses of all sizes.

This app aims to assists companies in gaining a transparent overview of their electricity consumption, enabling them to make well-informed and effective decisions.
